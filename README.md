Some Firebase functionalities require that you write a server application in order to use them.

This is very simple PHP application that exposes some useful API endpoints that you can use from your mobile or web app.

## Overview

1. For example, sending multiple Notifications from one device to several other
devices can not be done without a server app.
- This app uses [Firebase Admin SKD for PHP](https://github.com/kreait/firebase-php) under the hood

## Installation

  downloaded from Firebase, is not accessible from the net
